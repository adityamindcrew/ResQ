# Nearby Ambulances and Doctors
This project provides a RESTful API for managing doctors and ambulances. It includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, as well as pagination and filtering functionality.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- @vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- @vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh

# Functionality Overview:-
When you open the application, you will first be prompted to verify if you have admin permissions. To proceed as an admin, you need to enter a static password: "admin".
1.If you enter the correct password, you will access the application as an Admin.
2.If you enter an incorrect password or cancel the prompt, you will access the application as a User.
Sidebar Navigation
The application has two sidebar tabs:

üöë Ambulance Services (default selection):-
1.Medical Staff
2.Ambulance Services

By default, the Ambulance Services tab will be selected, and you will see a list of ambulances available for each location.
At the top of the screen, there is a location selector dropdown that allows you to filter and view data specific to a selected location.
User Role:-
If you access the application as a User, the list will be displayed, but you will not see the Actions column or any admin functionalities.
Admin Role:-
If you access the application as an Admin:
You will see an "Add" button that allows you to add new ambulance data.
The Actions column will be visible, where you can:
1.Edit ambulance details
2.Delete ambulances

üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Medical Staff:-
The same functionalities (view, add, edit, and delete) apply to the Medical Staff tab when accessed as an Admin.

üîí Logout
To log out of the application, click on the avatar icon in the header and select the logout option.
